A quick patch to add pictures from the Open Library project to your OpenBiblio bibliography displays.
If there is an ISBN in the 020 $a subfield, it will fetch the relevant image from Open Library.  If there isn't an 020 $a, it won't bother.

To add, just put it in your shared/biblio_view.php
Tested with Obiblio 0.70.
